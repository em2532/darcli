## Lists Overview
A list is an abstract data type, and not a data structure. It implements an ordered collection of values, which may be repeated. A list is similar to an array, in that it contains objects in a linear order. [insert difference between list and array].

A list is often a building block for more complex data structures. For example stacks and queues can be implemented using a linked list. 


The difference between an array and a list is the runtime for Insertion is O(1). _NOTE: This assumes the list has a functionality to keep track of the head and tial of list_
