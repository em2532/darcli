## Cloud Best Practices
> "Everything fails all the time" - Werner Vogels

###  Design for Failure
If you build your system expecting parts to fail, and you migate a solution to compensate for that failure, then your overall system will not fail. Thinking about failure upfront allows you to think about design strategies to recover ahead of time, improving the integrity of your overall system; which in hand will lead to a better, more stable product over time.

* Avoid single points of failure (for example, using a single database server). AWS offers RDS for fail over servers. RDS takes care of synchronization details, so when our primary database fails, we can switch to our other database, which is happily standing by for such an evenet.

#### Failover with EC2 and Elastic IP
EC2 is the service that provides you with the virtual servers and elastic IPs you'll need. The elastic nature of this service allows you not to worry about the idea of too few servers or too many servers. _Elastic IP's_ are static IP's designed for dynamic cloud computing. Unlike a traditional IP, you can control this elastic IP, and determine when you want to release it, this allows you to easily remap your IP to any instance in your account.

With traditional IP, if your server dies, your static IP is still pointing to that down'd server, even if you have a backup server, that backup is pointing to an entirely new IP. You would have to change your DNS setting to point to the new server. With Elastic IP, you can simply remap the association of the IP to a failed server, to a new server.

### AWS Regions and Availability Zones
EC2 can be launched it different geographical regions. 


### Implement Elasticity
* Elasticity: ability to scale cloud resources
* Schedule-based proactive scaling (scales when resources are needed, for example, peak usage time)
* Event-based scaling (a sudden influx of new users based on new marketing techniques)
* Automate deployment preprocessor
* streamline your build-and-configuration process (available in UI or console)
* Bootstrap your instances (creating a self-sustaining startup process that can run on its own, usually runs within EC2)

### Decouple your components
Minimize dependencies between components such that if a component fails, others continue working. e.g. Several web servers and web apps with a database (neither web server or web app should be aware of each other or rely on each  other, each component should be independent)
* Solution is to employ Loose Coupling techniques, this is where you incorporate a load balancer into the process, so that components are no longer connected directly to each other.

### Security
Familiar yourself with cloud security and best practices. Many of the perceived lack of security in the cloud derives from customer misunderstanding. It is your responsibility to provide security at the Network and Application level.  A solution to application level security is using SSL in order to protect data in motion, you can manage your SSL certificate within AWS. You can also encrypt your data, for example AWS offers elastic block storage. Another security measure that can be taken is to rotate your access keys frequently as well as manage user access control using IAM. IAM allows you to create separate users for each person neededing access and then granting them access to only the services they need access to.
